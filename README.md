# Dataset:
I myself created very limited dataset by one hundred photos.This dataset included the images of five actresses. So that each actress had twenty photos in this dataset.

# Recognition Phase:
This phase focuses on recognizing actresses' face. The recognition phase makes use of SVM, decision tree, and KNN algorithm classifires. In the next project, I used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) deep learning algorithm for recognition phase.
