# Dataset:
I myself created very limited dataset by one hundred photos.These Photos included the images of five actresses. So that each actress had twenty photos in this dataset.

# Recognition Phase:
This phase focuses on recognizing actresses' face. The recognition Phase makes use of SVM, decision tree, and KNN algorithm classifires. In the next project, I use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) deep learning algorithm for recognition Phase.
